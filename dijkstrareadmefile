Dijkstra C

Dijkstra algorithm implementation in C. Provides the possibility of reading the adjacency matrix from file input, and generate another file as output; or reading and printing via terminal.

Algorithm description.
Current features

    Dijkstra shortest path algorithm implementarion, through an adjacency graph, directed or bidirectional.
    Supports both input and ouput via terminal and files.
    Supports CSV files representing the adjacency graph input. Don't be shy and use spreadsheets to create huges graphs!
    Supports drawing computed shortest path as output.
    Supports differents usages, one of them non verbosing, ideal for repeating program execution in a set of files.
    Applies segregations of concerns, separating logic from algorithm and from input/output through 3 main public interfaces:
        dijkstra.h, responsible of algorithm calculation. Completely reusable.
        IO_dijkstra.h, utilities for reading algorithm input via keyboard and printing output to terminal or files.
        graph_drawer.h, not a drawer actually, but has the responsability of calling the actual graph drawer, graphviz.
